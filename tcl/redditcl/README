PURPOSE
  TCL wrapper to perform simple GET API calls on reddit.com.

STATUS
  Working as of: 2015-02-28

DETAILS
  Currently only Only GET API calls are supported. It shouldn't be too
  difficult to write your own routines for POST and other calls though.
  There is also no error handling or re-acquiring of a token, no rate
  limiting, etc. This is currently a *very* simple wrapper / proof of
  concept.

INSTALL
  01 : Change the useragent to include your username, or at least
       something unique (respect reddit's API policy).
  02 : Call ::redditcl:get:token with your API credentials.
  03 : Make all future calls to ::redditcl:get with the URL of the
       API call, such as "/api/v1/me".
  04 : Use and enjoy.
