PURPOSE
  TCL wrapper to perform simple GET API calls on reddit.com.

STATUS
  Working as of: 2015-02-28

DETAILS
  Currently only Only GET API calls are supported. It shouldn't be too
  difficult to write your own routines for POST and other calls though.
  There is also no error handling or re-acquiring of a token. This is
  currently a *very* simple wrapper / proof of concept.

INSTALL
  01 : Call ::redditcl:get:token with your API credentials.
  02 : Make all future calls to ::redditcl:get:api with the URL of the
       API call, such as "/api/v1/me".
  03 : Use and enjoy.
