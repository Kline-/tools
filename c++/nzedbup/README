PURPOSE
  Threaded C++ program to call nZEDb update scripts.

STATUS
  Working as of: 2014-05-17

DETAILS
  This program uses system() calls to execute various PHP files required
  to keep nZEDb up to date. Each script is processed in its own thread
  and waits for a fixed delay between executions.

  Assumptions are made that php-cli is executable as "php" and that the
  nzedbup binary is placed in the nzedb/misc/update folder of your
  nZEDb installation. If you would like to change these parameters,
  they are all defined at the top of the cpp file and easy to modify.

INSTALL
  01 : Compile with "make".
  02 : Place the nzedbup binary in your nzedb/misc/update folder.
  03 : Use and enjoy.
