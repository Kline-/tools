PURPOSE
  Threaded C++ program to call nZEDb update scripts.

STATUS
  Working as of: 2014-05-17

DETAILS
  This program uses system() calls to execute update_binaries.php and
  update_releases.php. By default, update_binaries.php will pause 60s
  between executions and update_releases.php will pause 120s between
  executions.

  Assumptions are made that php-cli is executable as "php" and that the
  nzedbup binary is placed in the same directory as the two PHP scripts
  it calls. If you would like to change these parameters, they are all
  defined at the top of the cpp file and easy to modify.

INSTALL
  01 : Compile with "make".
  02 : Place the nzedbup binary in your nzedb/misc/update folder.
  03 : Use and enjoy.
