PURPOSE
  C++ program to illustrate a basic plugin system. Plugins can be compiled
  and loaded as needed by the main program.

STATUS
  Working as of: 2012-07-09

DETAILS
  This program is not very flexible (fixed strings, etc), but does provide
  a working example to build from. The dynamiclib binary will build and
  load hello.so, or output any errors while attempting to.

INSTALL
  01 : Compile with "make".
  02 : Use and enjoy.
