PURPOSE
  C++ program to act as a policy file daemon for Adobe Flash clients.

STATUS
  Working as of: 2012-02-22

DETAILS
  Adobe Flash requires a policy file to be served on port 843 before
  allowing TCP connections via a Flash application. This program is
  designed to sit behind xinetd and send a policy file on request.

INSTALL
  01 : Compile with "make".
  02 : Copy flashpolicyd to a location accessible to xinetd such as
       /usr/local/sbin
       Ensure the file can be executed: chmod +x flashpolicyd
  02 : Copy flashpolicyd.xml to a location accessible to xinetd such as
       /usr/local/etc
       Edit the values to reflect your domain hostname and ports you
       wish to allow Flash to connect to.
  03 : Copy flashpolicyd.xinetd to the folder your system uses for xinetd
       service files. On Debian-based distributions, this is
       /usr/etc/xinetd.d
       Edit the values to reflect where you have stored your flashpolicyd.xml
       file.
  04 : Restart or reload xinetd.
  05 : Use and enjoy.
