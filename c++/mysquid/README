PURPOSE
  C++ program to allow Squid proxy to interface with a MySQL database for
  external ACL lookups.

STATUS
  Working as of: 2013-02-22

DETAILS
  A complete SQL query should be passed as a single argument via Squid.
  Each Squid token subsequently passed beyond that will be inserted in
  order between any double pairs of ##.

  If Squid passes %DST='test.com', ##TOK## would be replaced in the following:
    external_acl_type mysquid %DST /path/to/mysquid "SELECT `url` FROM `blocked_domains` WHERE `url` LIKE '##TOK##';"
  Resulting in a SQL query of:
    SELECT `url` from `blocked_domains` WHERE `url` LIKE 'test.com';

  Any number of arbitrarily named tokens may be used so long as each
  is enclosed in double pairs of ##.

INSTALL
  01 : Compile with "make".
  02 : Properly re-configure your Squid.
  02 : Use and enjoy.
